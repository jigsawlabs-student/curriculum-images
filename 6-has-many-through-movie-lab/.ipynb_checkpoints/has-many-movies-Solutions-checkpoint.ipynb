    "In this lab we will continue to look at the \"Has-Many\" relationships in our data. The database we will be using during this lab contains information about a selection of movies and related entities such as actors, directors and writers. A movie entity will have relationships with actor, director, and writer entities. The actors, directors and writers will also have relationships with themselves (i.e. a director will have worked with many actors). In problems below, we will use our knowledge of these relationships to build SQL queries."
